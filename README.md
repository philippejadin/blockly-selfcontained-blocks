# Proposal for self contained blocks inside blockly

Problem we are trying to solve : it is hard to share blockes between blockly installs : files representing one block 
are in various directories, making it hard to just copy a directory to install a new block inside blockly.

This repository contains some sample blocks and documentation to fix this. This is a proposal or a kind of RFC for blockly. 
Please comment on the blockly google group or in this repository issue queue.
